# htsget GEL implementation

Here you can find the Genomics England implementation of htsget, a protocol for secure, efficient and reliable access to genomic data.
This protocol builds on existing well-supported file formats for transport, while giving service providers freedom to use alternative internal data storage models.
Using existing formats means that tools and data processing pipelines are only required to make minimal modifications to support htsget.
